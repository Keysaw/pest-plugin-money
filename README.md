# Pest Plugin Money

This package is a plugin for [Pest PHP](https://pestphp.com).

It provides useful expectations for testing monetary values, provided by popular libraries
like [brick/money](https://github.com/brick/money), [moneyphp/money](https://github.com/moneyphp/money) and [archtechx/money](https://github.com/archtechx/money).
